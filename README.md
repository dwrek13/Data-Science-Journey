# Data-Science-Journey
Projects from my technical training on the path to a career change!

Not much to mention at the moment. This will be a place for me to add various projects that I complete while learning the necessary technical skills for the field
of data. I'll include projecta from various sources including Python, R, Tableau, and BI. As I progress, I'll hopefully be able to look back and identify areas where I can improve, as well as highlight some projects I'd most like to present in the future.
